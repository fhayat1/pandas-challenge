PyCity Schools Analysis
* The average math and reading scores stay steady across grade level when grouped by school. There is no major upgrading in scores from any school.
* Math passing rates are always consistently lower across every metric, but the alteration between math and reading passing rates is greater among lower performing schools, large schools, and higher spending per student which all seem to correlate.
* The top 5 schools are all charter schools while the bottom 5 all district schools.
* Overall (one exception), per student spending is higher in bottom performing schools than top performing.
* Schools under 2000 students have much higher passing rates than those with student populations above 2000. A comparison of 95 to 75%. The same phenomenon is seen with high and low per student spending brackets and district versus charter schools.
